## Needed info

    This web application was designed for the sole and exclusive use of the volunteer firefighters of the La Falda barracks, for the registration of confidential information. Not for people who do not belong to it, therefore, its use is not recommended for people who are not part of the barracks.

## Description

    This website will be used by firefighters to record information about different emergencies that occur, being saved by the system. Firefighters will be able to enter thanks to their ID and a password that will be given to them, depending on the rank that the firefighter has, they will be able to enter in some places, but not in others, for example a volunteer will have limited entry, while one with a higher rank will not.
